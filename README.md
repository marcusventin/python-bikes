# Python Bikes
### Featuring the Bicycle Repair Man

## Motivation
This project is a repeat of my earlier [Boris Bikes](https://github.com/marcusventin/boris-bikes) exercise. While that project was completed using Ruby, this project serves as an introduction to Python.

This project is intended to satisfy the following user stories:  
> As a person,  
> So that I can use a bike,  
> I'd like a docking station to release a bike.

> As a person,  
> So that I can use a good bike,  
> I'd like to see if a bike is working.

> As a member of the public,  
> So I can return bikes I've hired,  
> I want to dock my bike at the docking station.

> As a member of the public,  
> So I can decide whether to use the docking station,  
> I want to see a bike that has been docked.  

> As a member of the public,  
> So that I am not confused and charged unnecessarily,  
> I'd like docking stations not to release bikes when there are none available.
